## üé® Image Tips

### For Company Logos:
1. **Use transparent backgrounds** (PNG format) if possible
2. Keep them **professional** and **official**
3. Make sure they're **high resolution** (not pixelated)
4. Square format works best (the CSS will handle resizing)

### For Project Screenshots:
1. **Take full-screen screenshots** for best quality
2. **Clean up the interface** before capturing:
   - Close unnecessary browser tabs
   - Hide personal information
   - Make sure data is presentable
3. **Highlight key features** - show your best work
4. **Use good lighting** if it's a dark/light theme toggle
5. **Consider adding annotations** (arrows, highlights) using tools like:
   - Snagit
   - Greenshot
   - Paint / Paint.NET
   - Photoshop

## üñºÔ∏è Profile Photo Tips

Update the profile photo reference in `index.html`:
- Change `src="your-image.jpg"` to `src="myphoto.jpg"` (or whatever you name it)
- **Professional headshot** recommendations:
  - Good lighting
  - Professional attire
  - Neutral background
  - Smiling and approachable
  - Square aspect ratio (500x500px minimum)

## üîß Quick Fixes

### If an image doesn't show up:
1. ‚úÖ Check the filename matches exactly (case-sensitive)
2. ‚úÖ Check the file is in the same folder as index.html
3. ‚úÖ Check the file extension (.png vs .jpg)
4. ‚úÖ Try refreshing the browser (Ctrl+F5)

### If logos look stretched:
- The CSS is set to `object-fit: contain` which prevents stretching
- Just make sure your logos are square-ish

### If project images are too large:
- They're set to max-width: 600px and will scale responsively
- You can resize them before adding to save loading time

## üéØ Alternative: Using Placeholder Services

If you don't have images yet, you can test with placeholders:

```html
<!-- For logos -->
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/200x200/667eea/ffffff?text=Criteo" alt="Criteo">

<!-- For project images -->
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/1200x800/667eea/ffffff?text=Project+Screenshot" alt="Project">
```

**Note:** The website uses `onerror="this.style.display='none'"` which means if an image is missing, it will simply hide that element rather than showing a broken image icon. This allows you to add images gradually!
